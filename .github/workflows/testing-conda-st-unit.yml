  # Currently, every conda  build package has to be uploaded to Anaconda, so the package name can be passed onto this workflow.
  # It's a bug on the build actions team to fix. The alternative is to upload it as an artifact to Github server, and pass that reference around instead.
  # So this code is being kept around , just in case we want to pivot: 

      # - name: Download Conda package artifact

      #  with:
      #    name: "${{ matrix.os }}-fermitools-package"
      #    path: downloaded-package # Directory where the artifact will be downloaded

  # Currently,  we only run : ST-unit-test
  # But the plan is to include Tom's Likelihood tests, Threads testing that Don does manually, and Nestor is creating jupyter notebooks that can be ran as tests too.
  # BUG: This doesn't handle Tags RC and MAIN, it will only pull from tag dev.
